#### Error tracking

In case of any error, an animation page will show and the error will
be reported to the Sentry application monitoring. You can restart the
application by just refreshing the page.

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a
development env running

1 - Clone the project

```
git clone <project_url>
```

2 - Enter the project folder

```
cd <project_folder>
```

3 - Install project libraries

```
npm install
```

4 - Run the project

```
npm start
```

## Running the tests

### Jest + enzyme

Simple snapshot and component tests are done using Jest + Enzyme. Each
component has a folder **tests** with its snapshot and component
tests. To run the jest tests
run:

```
npm run test
```

### E2E Integration tests - Cypress

The project have few integration tests, which checks the 404 page and
the process of adding and deleting a contact. To run the integration test:

** the cypress is expecting the front to run at http://localhost:3000/. If
you run the front server on another port, please change the baseUrl at
cypress.json
```
npx  cypress open
```

The interface from cypress will open. You can run the test and
check the result

## Build

```
npm run build
```

### Running on a http server

To serve the build in a server, just copy the generated content
from the build folder to the http server service. You can also try the build
locally using the package https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server

### Tested browsers && CI/CD
tested on chrome and safari

the CI/CD used is the one from github actions, only running the simple snapshot
tests



## Versioning

Versioning is done by a internal process.

### git

In order to maintain the project best practices and prevent bugs. Husky is
set to run eslint (airbnb style) fixes, maintain prettier style
and run the tests before commit and push.
